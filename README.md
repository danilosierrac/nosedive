#Nosedive

Nosedive, your Black Mirror-inspired CV Template. Rate everyone, rate everything.

This is a small profile page I made with a Start Bootstrap Template. 

I took inspiration in the beautiful UI from the Nosedive Episode of Black Mirror (S03E01)

I know the code is not perfect as it is a first draft and a side-project, but I left some annotations to help you customise it and make it yours. 

I hope to refine it more later. 

Feel free to play around with it <3

Made with love in mimosa agency (mimosaagency.com)

How to install

1. Download the repository as a zip file or clone it to your desktop
2. Edit the index and the stylesheet
3. Change the files, try to use similar ratio for the images as it is responsive, but so far hard-coded. If you want a feed or other widget, feel free to check the official ones from the social networks of your choice.

Have fun!
